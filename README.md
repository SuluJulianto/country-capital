Country-Capital Lookup

This Python script facilitates the association between countries and their respective capitals. The data utilized in this code is sourced from two Indonesian-language websites: CNBC Indonesia source and IDN Times source. The program allows users to input a country's name and retrieve its corresponding capital. The displayed output reveals the capital city of the entered country. Additionally, for added reference, the script randomly showcases the capital of another country.

This functionality is achieved through a dictionary structure in Python, where country names are keys and their respective capitals are stored as values. Users input a country's name, and the program retrieves the corresponding capital from this dataset. In cases where the country input doesn't match the dataset, a message indicating the absence of the country in the database is displayed.

The code also includes a randomization feature to present the capital of a different country after providing the requested information. This addition allows users to explore various country-capital pairs beyond their initial query.

Please note that while the code and its functionality are explained in English, the sources for the country-capital data are Indonesian-language websites.
